# Bicopter
A project meant to control a drone using a computer and a raspberry pi using inputs from the user's computer. 

# Explanation
This project is meant to control a drone via a wireless connection from the user's computer to a Raspberry Pi that is attached to the drone (also is controlling the drone). The way this works is that the user uses either a keyboard or controller and uses this for input. The input is then sent to the drone where it uses that input to control the drone. 

# Modules needed 
You can use "pip install (module)" in your terminal/command prompt to download these 

* switchcase
* keyboard
* mouse

# Warnings 
* **IF ON LINUX, MAKE SURE YOU ARE A ROOT USER (It will not be able to detect keyboard/controller input otherwise)**
